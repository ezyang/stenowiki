The collaborative stroke wiki

- Take this seriously: this is a way for people to share their own
  custom dictionaries.

    - Some sort of way to upload dictionaries. (Start of with a simple
      JSON upload, but maybe something fancier like ability to access
      your dictionary on Dropbox so that you can set the dictionary
      to autoshare and forget about it.)  Publish it so that other
      tools (like Stenomatic) can import the dictionary in.

    - On the stroke page, we default to displaying the mapping in the
      default Plover dictionary.  However, we then display alternate
      mappings from user dictionaries.

    - On the word page, we display all of the default Plover mappings.
      Then we display added user mappings for the word.

    - Maintain a relationship table between dictionaries and strokes;
      when someone updates a dictionary, this relationship table is
      updated differentially.

- Spam filtering capabilities so that we can open edits to anonymous

- Export database to JSON

Other:

- Behavior for prefix strokes is a bit wrong

- Unit tests

- Flag a stroke (because it's weird and you want to know what it means!)

- After editing stroke go to previous page (e.g. if one word page,
  go back to word page)

- On login, return to the page you previously were on

- JavaScript API, search as you type

- Nice widget for phonetic soundings: in particular, the widget
  can suggest the most probable next soundings, e.g. given -FP
  it can suggest "f p" or "ch"

- Ability to access history

- More options for how links are rendered: e.g. don't include
  annotations, or also mention the word in a stroke link

- Render broken links differently.  Also, distinguish between words
  which are not strokeable, versus words which have no entries?

- Handle orthographics in reverse lookup (and upstream to Plover!)
