Release blocker:

- Index page and search boxes

- Export database to JavaScript

- User logins, and mention who last edited a page

- Automatically prefill word pages with strokes that produce the word.
  This is a little algorithmically complex if we want to handle orthographics
  (Release blocker is just the simple prefill)

- Checkbox for if it is a brief

- CSS rules for rendering misstrokes, and indicate a misstroke
  differently in the UI

Other:

- JavaScript API, search as you type

- Nice widget for phonetic soundings: in particular, the widget
  can suggest the most probable next soundings, e.g. given -FP
  it can suggest "f p" or "ch"

- Ability to access history

- More options for how links are rendered: e.g. don't include
  annotations, or also mention the word in a stroke link

- Render broken links differently.  Also, distinguish between words
  which are not strokeable, versus words which have no entries?
