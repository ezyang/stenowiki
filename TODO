Other:

- Flag a stroke (because it's weird and you want to know what it means!)

- Spam filtering capabilities so that we can open edits to anonymous

- User dictionary sharing!!

- {{- g t}} for soundings without linking

- After editing stroke go to previous page (e.g. if one word page,
  go back to word page)

- CSS rules for rendering misstrokes, and indicate a misstroke
  differently in the UI

- CSS rules for rendering briefs

- On login, return to the page you previously were on

- Export database to JavaScript

- JavaScript API, search as you type

- Nice widget for phonetic soundings: in particular, the widget
  can suggest the most probable next soundings, e.g. given -FP
  it can suggest "f p" or "ch"

- Alternate rendering for some phonemes?

- Ability to access history

- More options for how links are rendered: e.g. don't include
  annotations, or also mention the word in a stroke link

- Render broken links differently.  Also, distinguish between words
  which are not strokeable, versus words which have no entries?

- Handle orthographics in reverse lookup (and upstream to Plover!)
