Release blocker:

- User logins, and mention who last edited a page

- CSS rules for rendering misstrokes, and indicate a misstroke
  differently in the UI

- CSS rules for rendering briefs

Other:

- Export database to JavaScript

- JavaScript API, search as you type

- Nice widget for phonetic soundings: in particular, the widget
  can suggest the most probable next soundings, e.g. given -FP
  it can suggest "f p" or "ch"

- Ability to access history

- More options for how links are rendered: e.g. don't include
  annotations, or also mention the word in a stroke link

- Render broken links differently.  Also, distinguish between words
  which are not strokeable, versus words which have no entries?

- Recently updated list

- Handle orthographics in reverse lookup (and upstream to Plover!)
