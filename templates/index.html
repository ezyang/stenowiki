  <h1>StenoWiki</h1>
  <p><strong>StenoWiki</strong> is a collaborative wiki for documenting
  and describing the <a href="http://plover.stenoknight.com/">Plover</a>
  stenography theory.  If you've ever wondered, "Why is that stroked
  this way?" or "How was this brief constructed?", this wiki is for you!
  Our hope is to construct a useful, living document to help you
  understand the theory.</p>
